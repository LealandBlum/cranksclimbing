                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introductions</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to what could be your first introduction to climbing technique! Throughout the years, crushers (climbers that finish your project with their eyes closed) have been perfecting their trade. As climbing has spread throughout the world we see more and more ways to perfect scaling big walls and small boulders.</p>
                        <p>We'll discuss the basic topic of safety and helmets. This is a beginners guide and with that we encourage you to get outside and put it into practice.</p>
                        <p>Before we get into it we'd like to take a minute and remind climbers that going and climbing is going to be your number one teacher. Make some friends, be safe, and have some fun!</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Safety and Helmets</h2>
                        
                        <p>The first things any climber should cover is safety technique. I know, I know. Who wants to listen to the local safety nut about does and don'ts, but there is a reason they don't visit the hospital. Safety should be one of your first concerns when climbing. We have lost too many wonderful to slip ups and disregard for safety. </p>
                        <p>One of the first steps that should be taken when practicing proper safety technique is buying a helmet. Yep, your mum was right when she was yelling at you to put a helmet on. Too many new climbers make their last purchase a helmet. I may have been guilty of that myself as I focused on the more expensive "Essential" gear such as quickdraws, a haul bag, and a rope. No small purchases for a new climber. </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Yep, your mum was right when she was yelling at you to put a helmet on.</blockquote>
                        <p>$300-$400 on your essentials seems to be enough cash spent and another $70 for a helmet seems like overkill. Couldn't you just wear a bike helmet? You're not planning on falling either, right? <br> <br> Wrong.</p>
                        <p>A climbing helmet is not the same as a bike helmet and your poor noggin will say the same when you've got a rock sticking out of it. Buying a climbing specific helmet will give your noodle the protection it needs because of its design. Rocks, pebbles, or boulders are often kicked off, pulled out or nudged ever slightly as climbers go up routes. This sends stones, like little missles, plumetting to the ground. Often landing where you're standing. You lucky duck, you.</p>
                        <p>Now you're being showered in small to large debris that has been bestowed upon you by your climbing partner. (You can decide to forgive them later) What are you to do? </p>
                        <p>Don't look up. Your face is never covered and taking a rock to it doesn't sound pleasant. Instead make your body small and get yourself as close to the wall as possible without endangering your climber or yourself. This will help the rocks fall behind and away from you rather than landing on your shiny bald head. Or whatever you're beautiful noodle looks like...</p> 
                        <p>Back to the unsolicited shower of rocks. Luckily you're wearing your brand new, shiny, never sweat in, helmet which protects the top of your head. Instead of the rocks raining down and sticking into your bike helmet or worse your dome, they bounce off the top like water off your trusty old shower cap. Leaving you with a scratched and a little dented helmet and a slightly sweaty, safe, head.</p>
